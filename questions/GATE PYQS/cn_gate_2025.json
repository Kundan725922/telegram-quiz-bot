    "options": [
      "A) S1: Used in Ethernet",
      "B) S2: Monitors channel for collision",
      "C) S3: Works in wireless networks",
      "D) S4: Frame size depends on propagation delay"
    ],
    "correct_answer": ["A", "B", "D"],
    "explanation": "S1 ✓ CORRECT: CSMA/CD is the fundamental protocol for wired Ethernet (IEEE 802.3). S2 ✓ CORRECT: Stations monitor the medium while transmitting to detect collisions. S3 ✗ INCORRECT: CSMA/CD cannot be used in wireless (hidden terminal problem, can't transmit and listen simultaneously). Wireless uses CSMA/CA instead. S4 ✓ CORRECT: Minimum frame size = 2 × Bandwidth × Propagation delay, ensuring collision detection. Correct: S1, S2, S4",

    "explanation": "S1 ✓ CORRECT: Digital signatures verify the sender's identity (authentication). S2 ✓ CORRECT: Sender cannot deny signing the message (non-repudiation). S3 ✗ INCORRECT: Digital signatures do NOT provide confidentiality. The message is readable by anyone. For confidentiality, you need encryption. S4 ✓ CORRECT: Uses private key to sign, public key to verify (asymmetric cryptography). Correct: S1, S2, S4",
