    "q": "[MSQ] Which of the following is/are correct about CSMA/CD?\n\nS1: It is used in Ethernet\nS2: Collision detection is done by monitoring the channel\nS3: It can be used in wireless networks\nS4: Minimum frame size depends on propagation delay\n\nSelect ALL correct statements:",
    "options": [
      "S1: Used in Ethernet",
      "S2: Monitors channel for collision",
      "S3: Works in wireless networks",
      "S4: Frame size depends on propagation delay"
    ],
    "answer": [0, 1, 3],
    "explanation": "S1 ✓ CORRECT: CSMA/CD is the fundamental protocol for wired Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)\n\nS2 ✓ CORRECT: Stations monitor the medium while transmitting to detect collisions\n\nS3 ✗ INCORRECT: CSMA/CD cannot be used in wireless (hidden terminal problem, can't transmit and listen simultaneously). Wireless uses CSMA/CA instead.\n\nS4 ✓ CORRECT: Minimum frame size = 2 × Bandwidth × Propagation delay, ensuring collision detection\n\nCorrect: S1, S2, S4"

    "q": "[MSQ] Which of the following is/are true about digital signatures?\n\nS1: Digital signature provides authentication\nS2: Digital signature provides non-repudiation\nS3: Digital signature provides confidentiality\nS4: Digital signature uses public key cryptography\n\nSelect ALL correct statements:",
    "options": [
      "S1: Provides authentication",
      "S2: Provides non-repudiation",
      "S3: Provides confidentiality",
      "S4: Uses public key cryptography"
    ],
    "answer": [0, 1, 3],
    "explanation": "S1 ✓ CORRECT: Digital signatures verify the sender's identity (authentication)\n\nS2 ✓ CORRECT: Sender cannot deny signing the message (non-repudiation)\n\nS3 ✗ INCORRECT: Digital signatures do NOT provide confidentiality. The message is readable by anyone. For confidentiality, you need encryption.\n\nS4 ✓ CORRECT: Uses private key to sign, public key to verify (asymmetric cryptography)\n\nCorrect: S1, S2, S4"
